Bixo has some early, limited support for working with DMOZ data.

The Open Directory Project makes available RDF dumps of their database,
which are free for all to use. See http://rdf.dmoz.org/ for details.

Bixo has some tools, located in the bixo.tools package, that can process
the dmoz.xml file (1.9GB) to extract links (ExtractDmozLinks) and
unique domains (ExtractDmozDomains).
