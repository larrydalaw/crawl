The only library you'll find here in the /lib subdirectory is the one
that's used to bootstrap our use of Maven's dependency management
support.

All other jars are automatically downloaded from either the Maven
central repository (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/) or the 101tec
repository (http://oss.101tec.com/nexus/content/groups/public/)
